Techstack
1. Architecture Overview
FleetFlow utilizes a Client-Server Architecture separating the presentation layer (React) from the business logic and data access layers (Django + PostgreSQL). Communication between the frontend and backend is handled via a RESTful API using JSON.
2. Frontend: Presentation & UI Layer
Core Framework: React.js
Build Tool: Vite (Faster compilation and hot-module replacement than Create React App, crucial for an 8-hour hackathon).
Routing: React Router v6 (For seamless navigation between the Dashboard, Registry, Dispatcher, etc., without page reloads).
State Management: Context API or Zustand (Lightweight global state management for handling the logged-in user's role and RBAC permissions without the heavy boilerplate of Redux).
API Client: Axios (For making HTTP requests to the Django backend. It handles JSON transformation and token injection automatically).
UI & Styling
CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building the custom "clean and interactive UI" mentioned in the rubric).
Component Library: Headless UI or Radix UI (Unstyled, accessible components for modals, dropdowns, and status pills, saving time on complex UI behaviors).
Charting: Recharts or Chart.js (React wrappers to quickly build the Fuel Efficiency Trend and Top 5 Costliest Vehicles charts on the Analytics page).
Icons: Lucide-React or Heroicons (Consistent, SVG-based iconography for the sidebar menu).
3. Backend: Business Logic & API Layer
Core Framework: Django (Python)
API Framework: Django REST Framework (DRF) (To rapidly serialize database models into JSON and handle viewsets for CRUD operations).
Authentication: SimpleJWT (JSON Web Token authentication for secure, stateless user sessions).
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing: django-cors-headers (To allow the React frontend running on a different port to communicate with the Django server).
Business Logic Enforcement: Django Signals (The perfect tool to handle the "Auto-Hide" rule—e.g., a signal that listens for a new MaintenanceLog and automatically updates the related Vehicle status to "In Shop").
4. Database: Data Persistence Layer
Core Database: PostgreSQL
Adapter: psycopg2-binary (The standard PostgreSQL database adapter for Python/Django).
Why PostgreSQL?: Fulfills the hackathon's strict requirement for a local, relational database. It excels at handling complex JOINs (e.g., calculating ROI by joining Vehicles, Expenses, and Trips) and ensures ACID compliance for dispatch transactions.
Schema Management: Django ORM (Handles database migrations and strict constraint validation, like ensuring cargo_weight <= vehicle.max_capacity at the database level).
5. Development & Tooling
Version Control: Git & GitHub (Demonstrates "shared ownership and teamwork" as requested by the judges).
Environment Variables: python-dotenv (Backend) and .env (Frontend) to keep database credentials and secret keys secure.
Code Quality: ESLint & Prettier (Frontend) / Flake8 & Black (Backend) to ensure consistent coding standards across the team.
6. Local Development Setup
Since you are avoiding BaaS, the local setup is straightforward:
Database: Run PostgreSQL locally (or via a quick Docker container: docker run --name fleetflow-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 -d postgres).
Backend: python manage.py runserver (Usually runs on localhost:8000).
Frontend: npm run dev (Usually runs on localhost:5173).

4. Technical Stack & Architecture
Frontend: React.js for building a clean, modular UI with reusable components (KPI cards, tables, modal forms).
Backend: Django (Python). Its MVT architecture is perfect for rapidly building secure, scalable endpoints and strictly enforcing the business logic.
Database: PostgreSQL. A highly normalized local relational database to link Expenses, Trips, and Logs to specific Vehicle IDs, satisfying the judges' requirement to avoid BaaS platforms.
Data Handling: Real-time state management for vehicle and driver availability, strictly avoiding static JSON for the final solution.
5. Critical Business Logic & Constraints
To win the technical evaluation, the system must enforce these strict rules at the backend level:
The "In Shop" Auto-Hide Rule: Inserting a record into the Maintenance Log must automatically trigger a status update for that specific vehicle to "In Shop." This status must prevent the vehicle from appearing in the Dispatcher's selection pool.
The Cargo Weight Lock: The system must intercept any trip creation request. If the input Cargo Weight exceeds the assigned vehicle's Max Payload, the backend must reject the request and return a graceful, user-friendly error to the React frontend.
The License Expiry Lock: Before a driver can be assigned to a new trip, the system must verify their license expiry date. Expired drivers must be locked out of the assignment pool automatically.
Automated ROI Math: Vehicle ROI must be dynamically calculated using the formula: (Revenue - (Maintenance + Fuel)) / Acquisition Cost.
6. Hackathon Execution & Deployment Strategy
To maximize your points for teamwork, shared ownership, and presentation, structure your hackathon timeline efficiently. Drawing on the rhythm required for fast-paced events like the Cyfuture AI Hackathon, cleanly split the React component building and the Django API development among your team from hour one.
For the final pitch, bypass local development servers. Deploying the PostgreSQL database and Django backend on a Linux VPS, much like the infrastructure used for GetMeAChai, will give the judges a live, robust application to interact with.

what it's for: This is the "brain" of the operation. It's where you actually set up deliveries and move goods from one place to another.
How it works:
Bookng a Trp: You pick a vehicle and a driver that are currently free and ready to go. You eter how much the cargo weighs. If you try to put a 2,000kg load into a 1,000kg van the system will block you and say, "Too heavy!"
Trip Progress: You can track the status of the job as it moves through four stages:
Ui :
1. Vehicle Registry (Asset Management)
This interface focuses on adding and tracking the physical fleet.
Main Dashboard View:
Search & Utility: Features a top-aligned search bar alongside "Group by," "Filter," and "Sort by..." buttons.
Action Trigger: A blue "+ New Vehicle" button is positioned on the right. An arrow indicates that clicking this opens the registration modal.
Data Table: Displays vehicle information under pink headers: NO, Plate, Model, Type, Capacity, Odometer, Status, and Actions.
Sample Record: Row 1 shows a "Mini" model from 2017 with a "5 tonn" capacity and "Idle" status.
New Vehicle Registration (Modal):
Input Fields: A pop-up form collects the License Plate, Max Payload, Initial Odometer, Type, and Model.
Controls: Contains "Save" and "Cancel" buttons at the bottom.
2. Trip Dispatcher & Management

Active Trips Table (Top):
Contains columns for Trip, Fleet Type, Origin, Destination, and Status.
Example Entry: Trip 1 features a "Trailer Truck" traveling from "Mumbai" to "Pune" with an "On way" status.
New Trip Form (Bottom):
A dedicated section for inputting logistics data.
Data Entry Fields:
Select Vehicle: To assign an available asset.
Cargo Weight (Kg): For payload tracking.
Select Driver: To assign personnel.
Origin Address & Destination: To define the route.
Estimated Fuel Cost: For budget forecasting.
Primary Action: A green-outlined "Confirm & Dispatch Trip" button at the bottom.
Maintenance & service logs
Description:What it's for This is where you keep your vehieles healthy. It tracks every tice a vehicle goes in for a check-up or a repair.
How it Works:
Logsing a Repair: When a vehiele needs work (ike an oil change or new tires), you create a log entry here.
The Auto -Hide" Rule: As soon as you add a vekiele to a maintenanee log, the system automatically marks it as "In Shop." The Benefit: While a vehicle is "In shop,' the Dispatcher cannot see it or pick it For a new trip. This prevents you fron accidentally sending a broken truck out on a delivery.
Ui:
1. Service Log Dashboard (Fleet Flow)
The main container serves as the central hub for tracking the health of the fleet. It is organized into several key functional areas:
Global Navigation & Search: At the top, a "Search bar..." is paired with secondary controls for Group by, Filter, and Sort by... to help users manage large volumes of data.
Action Trigger: A prominent "Create New Service" button is located above the table. A red arrow indicates that clicking this button opens the input modal.
Maintenance Log Table: A structured table that tracks the status of repairs. The headers include:
Log ID: Unique identifier (e.g., "321").
Vehicle: The specific unit (e.g., "TATA").
Issue/Service: Description of the work (e.g., "Engine Issue").
Date: Entry date (e.g., "20/02").
Cost: Estimated or final expense (e.g., "10k").
Status: Current state of the log (e.g., "New").
2. "New Service" Modal
When a user initiates a repair log, a focused entry window appears on the left with the following input fields:
Vehicle Name: A text input to specify which truck is being serviced.
Issue/Service: A text input to describe the problem (e.g., oil change, tires).
Date: A date picker or text field for scheduling.
Buttons: Two distinct actions at the bottom: Create (Green) to confirm the entry and Cancel (Red) to discard changes.
3. Core Logic: The "Auto-Hide" Rule
The UI is built around a specific safety workflow described in your notes:
Automatic Status Update: Saving a new log automatically marks the vehicle as "In Shop."
Dispatcher Restriction: Once marked "In Shop," the vehicle is hidden from the Dispatcher's view.
Primary Benefit: This creates a digital safeguard, ensuring broken or serviced vehicles cannot be accidentally assigned to new trips.
Expense & Fuel logging
Description:
wlet at's for: Tk's is the dtgitel "wallet" for your fleet. It tracks exactly how much money is being spent to keep your vehicles moving,
How Works:
Fadl Tracking: Every time a driver fills up the tank, you record how many liters they bought and how wuch it cost
Cost per Velicle The system automatically connects these receipts to the specific vehicle used.
The Maths It adds up the fuel costs and the repair bils to show you the "Total Cost" for each vehicle. This helps you see if a specifie truck is becoming too epensve te kes
Ui:
1. Fleet Flow Dashboard
The primary interface is a management dashboard used to monitor ongoing and completed trip costs:
Search and Organization: The top header features a Search bar along with buttons for Group by, Filter, and Sort by... to organize trip data.
Primary Action: An "Add an Expense" button (highlighted in blue) triggers the creation of a new financial record.
Expense Log Table: A data grid that displays detailed trip costs. Visible columns include:
Trip ID: The unique identifier for the journey (e.g., "321").
Driver: The name of the person operating the vehicle (e.g., "John").
Distance: The total travel length (e.g., "1000 km").
Fuel Expense: Costs incurred for fueling (e.g., "19k").
Misc. Expen: Miscellaneous costs associated with the trip (e.g., "3k").
Status: The current state of the record (e.g., "Done").
2. "New Expense" Input Modal
Clicking the add button opens a side modal for manual data entry:
Trip ID: A field to link the expense to a specific journey.
Driver: An input for the driver's name.
Fuel Cost: A field to record the cost and volume of fuel purchased.
Misc Expense: A field for any additional costs like tolls or minor repairs.
Controls: Green Create and Cancel buttons to finalize or discard the entry.
3. Operational Logic
The backend of this UI is designed to automate financial analysis:
Vehicle Connectivity: The system automatically links receipts and fuel records to the specific vehicle used for the trip.
Total Cost Calculation: It aggregates fuel costs and repair bills to calculate the "Total Cost" per vehicle.
Insight Generation: This data helps management identify if a specific truck has become too expensive to maintain over time.
